git-svn bootstrap repository for freebsd-ports
==============================================

What is this branch for?
------------------------

This branch serves as a bootstrap for getting your own copy of a
git-svn enabled mirror repository of FreeBSD "ports".

It will include all available branches and tags.  You can refer to any
commit on any branch using Git and see what revision it corresponds
to.

Do not ever track this branch, it's just for one-time use and will
often be force-updated to avoid bloat.

How much disk space do I need?
------------------------------

You'll need approximately 1GB of disk space to have a git-svn clone of
the FreeBSD ports repository.

How long does it take?
----------------------

It highly depends on the bandwidth and disk performance, but in my
case the whole process finished in approximately 45 minutes.

How to use
----------

Take the following steps to get a git-svn working directory:

1. Clone this repository.  The git URL is preferred to https if you
   want to save time as much as possible.

        $ git clone git://github.com/knu/freebsd-ports.git

   If you don't have outbound access to the git port (9418), use the
   https URL instead.

        $ git clone https://github.com/knu/freebsd-ports.git

2. Go into the working directory and make sure you are on the
   `git-svn` branch.

        $ cd freebsd-ports
        $ git status
        # On branch git-svn
        nothing to commit, working directory clean

3. Execute `./run init`.  This sets up the repository for git-svn,
   extracting a snapshot of git-svn files and refs.

  * If you have a local mirror of the subversion repository:

        $ ./run init --repository=file:///path/to/repository

  * If you are a non-committer:

        $ ./run init --repository=svn://svn.freebsd.org/ports

  * If you are a committer:

        $ ./run init

4. Execute `./run fetch`.  This simply runs `git-svn fetch` to obtain
   the new commits since the snapshot was generated.

        $ ./run fetch

5. Execute `./run clean`.  This completely erases the trace of this
   bootstrap branch and changes the `origin` URL from
   [this fork](https://github.com/knu/freebsd-ports) to
   [the official mirror](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports).

        $ ./run clean

6. Start hacking!  Note that the `master` branch is branched off from
   [`origin/master`](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports/tree/master)
   and is not set up to track any subversion branch with git-svn.  To
   use commands like `git svn rebase` and `git svn dcommit`, create a
   branch from one of the remote branches that start with `svn/` and
   work in there.

        $ git checkout -b trunk svn/trunk
        (..hack..)
        $ git svn rebase
        $ git svn dcommit
